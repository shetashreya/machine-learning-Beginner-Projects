# Machine Learning Beginner Projects

## Overview
This repository contains beginner-friendly Machine Learning projects. The goal is to apply basic ML concepts to solve real-world problems using supervised learning techniques like regression and classification.

## Projects

### 1. Digit Recognition (MNIST)
- **Description**: A project to classify handwritten digits using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- **Dataset**: MNIST dataset.
- **Techniques Used**: Neural Networks, Image Processing, TensorFlow/Keras.
- **File**: `Digit_recognition.ipynb`

### 2. House Price Prediction
- **Description**: Predicting house prices using Linear Regression based on features like area, number of rooms, and location.
- **Dataset**: Housing dataset (e.g., Kaggle or Sklearn's built-in dataset).
- **Techniques Used**: Linear Regression, Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering.
- **File**: `House_Price_Prediction_using_Linear_Regression.ipynb`

## Requirements
To run the projects, install the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib tensorflow keras
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
